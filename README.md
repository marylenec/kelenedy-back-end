# kelenedy-back-end

The **Kelenedy** app utilizes a makeup API to create an online store such that a user can create a account, browse products by category and/or brand, create a favorite products list, and generate a shopping cart for their purchase.

Kelenedy uses **Ruby '2.3.3'** and the Makeup API found at http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

The **frontend** for Kelenedy can be found at https://github.com/kells08/kelenedy-front-end

To use the app, run `npm install` and `npm start` in the console.
